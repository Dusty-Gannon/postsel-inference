### Philosophical questions

- *Submodel* versus *full model* view.

    - @berk_valid_psi_2013 takes the *submodel view*. 
    
        - Models as approximations. Full model is *not* assumed to be the data generating process.
        
        - Deselected variable coefficients are not estimated at zero, they simply don't exist.
        
        - Definition of the estimator is: $\mathbb{E}(\hat{\boldsymbol \beta}_m) = \underset{{\boldsymbol \beta} \in \mathbb{R}^\mathcal{P}}{\text{arg min}} ||\boldsymbol \mu - {\bf X}_m \boldsymbol \beta ||^2$ where $\boldsymbol \mu$ is the true mean $\mathbb{E}(\bf Y)$, $\mathcal{P}$ is the dimension of the "full model" matrix, and $m$ denotes the submodel.
